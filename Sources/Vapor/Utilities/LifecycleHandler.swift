/// Provides a way to hook into lifecycle events of a Vapor application. You can register
/// your handlers with the ``Application`` to be notified when the application
/// is about to start up, has started up and is about to shutdown
///
/// For example
/// ```swift
///  struct LifecycleLogger: LifecycleHander {
///    func willBootAsync(_ application: Application) async throws {
///        application.logger.info("Application about to boot up")
///    }
///
///    func didBootAsync(_ application: Application) async throws {
///        application.logger.info("Application has booted up")
///    }
///
///    func shutdownAsync(_ application: Application) async {
///        application.logger.info("Will shutdown")
///    }
///  }
/// ```
///
/// You can then register your handler with the application:
///
/// ```swift
/// application.lifecycle.use(LifecycleLogger())
/// ```
///
