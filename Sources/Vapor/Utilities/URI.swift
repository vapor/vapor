// MARK: - URI

/// A type for constructing and manipulating (most) Uniform Resource Indicators.
///
/// > Warning: This is **NOT** the same as Foundation's [`URL`] type!
///
/// Can be used to both parse strings containing well-formed URIs and to generate such strings from
/// a set of individual URI components.
///
/// Use of this type is (gently, for now) discouraged. Consider using Foundation's [`URL`] and/or
/// [`URLComponents`] types instead. See below for details.
///
/// ## URI is for URLs, not URIs
///
/// Thanks to both backwards compatibility requirements and name collision concerns, this type, despite
/// its name, does not actually represent a generic Uniform Resource Identifier as defined by [RFC 3986].
/// In particular, the underlying implementation is currently based on Foundation's [`URLComponents`] type,
/// whose semantics are inconsistent between different methods; in addition, its behavior has differed
/// drastically between the macOS and Linux implementations for most of its existence, and continues to do
/// so in Swift 5.9. This is not expected to be remedied until the [`swift-foundation`] package reaches a
/// 1.0 release, which as of this writing will not for quite some time yet). In short, instances of `URI`
/// may not always behave as expected according to either the spec or what Foundation does.
